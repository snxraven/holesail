## Overview

Holesail is a truly peer-to-peer network tunneling and reverse proxy software that supports both TCP and UDP protocols.

Holesail lets you share any locally running application on a specific port with third parties securely and with a single command. No static IP or port forwarding required.


## Installation

Before using Holesail, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download Node.js from the official website: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Once Node.js is installed, you can install Holesail Server using npm (Node Package Manager):

```
npm i holesail -g
```

## Quick Usage

To start a local Holesail Server, use the following command:

```
holesail --live <port>
```
Replace `port` with the desired port number you want to expose to the network.

This will give you a connection string to connect to, use that to access this server from anywhere:

```
holesail <connection-string> 
```

## All commands

To view full usage instructions and all set of commands, run:
```
holesail --help
```
## API

### Usage

```js
const Holesail = require('holesail')

const hs = new Holesail({
  server: true, // act as a server
  secure: true  // use secure mode
})

await hs.ready()

console.log('Server is ready:', hs.info.url)

```

Or as a client:

```js
const Holesail = require('holesail')

const hs = new Holesail({
  client: true,
  key: 'hs://s000abcdef...', // URL or raw key
})

await hs.ready()

console.log('Client connected:', hs.info)

```

**API**

`new Holesail(opts)`

Options:

- server	Boolean	Start as server (default false)
- client	Boolean	Start as client (default false)
- key	String	Optional. URL or raw key for connecting
- secure	Boolean	Enable secure mode (default false)
- port	Number	Optional. Specific port to bind/connect
- host	String	Optional. Specific host to bind/connect
- udp	Boolean	Optional. Force UDP usage (advanced)

`.ready()`
Wait for Holesail to initialize and connect.

`.pause()`

`.resume()`

`.info()`
Get metadata about the current Holesail instance:

`.close()`
Gracefully shuts down the connection and releases resources.

## URL Format

Holesail uses a simple URL format for sharing server locations:

- Secure server: hs://s000<key>

- Insecure server: hs://0000<key>

The parser will auto-detect and split the prefix for you.
If you pass a full hs:// URL to the constructor, it'll Just Work
